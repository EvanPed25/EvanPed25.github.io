                        What is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp">C#</a>? "It is an object-oriented programming language created by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.

                        C# has roots from the C family, and the language is close to other popular languages like C++ and Java.

                        The first version was released in year 2002. The latest version, C# 12, was released in November 2023.

                        C# is used for:

                        Mobile applications, Desktop applications, Web applications, Web services, Web sites, Games, VR, Database applications, And much, much more!"

                        <br />
                        Over the course of my time at OU, I have created a pleathora of simple C# console and Web applications to help reinforce lessons from my professors such as the syntax, methods, loops, classes, break/continue, ans much more!

                    As you can see from this webpage, I have put some skill into creating this webpage with multiple pages, each with different content, but with the same style mixed thorughout. Granted this page isn't too complex, but it was created with hours of coding!

                    <br />
                    The main time I have used SQL was in my database class for creating, inserting, and requesting data into a database for our project (the ERD for that project can be seen on the Projects page). We used MySQL, which is an important detail becuase different data storage resources can have slightly different syntaxes when writing/creating queries. I have also used SQL outside of class to attempt to create a backend for an application that would serve as a running database for client tracking for a law firm. It has varied in progress, but SQL is the main portion to making it work, along with learning a little bit about Azure services.

                    I'll explain more in the Employment History page, but I was a Hospital Corpsman in the Navy and that is the medical enlistedmen that fill roles inside of hospitals, clinics, ships, and with Marine Corps units. Through this experience I gained knowledge and skills about combat and family medicine. I have helped patients across the age spectrum, anywhere from birth to death. I also briefly worked in a Level One Trauma center for training and was exposed to various trauma patients that taught me invaluable skills about saving life, as well as how to process death.
