                    I'll explain more in the Employment History page, but I was a Hospital Corpsman in the Navy and that is the medical enlistedmen that fill roles inside of hospitals, clinics, ships, and with Marine Corps units. Through this experience I gained knowledge and skills about combat and family medicine. I have helped patients across the age spectrum, anywhere from birth to death. I also briefly worked in a Level One Trauma center for training and was exposed to various trauma patients that taught me invaluable skills about saving life, as well as how to process death.
