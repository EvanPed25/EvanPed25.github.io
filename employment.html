                    I am currently working at the Target here in Norman. I primarily work as as a Food and Beverage Tech which is essentially a shelf stocker for Dry Grocries. I know where every single item is located in my part of the store, it is both a blessing and a curse.
                    I am also cross trained to work in most parts of the store. I am mostly pulled into the Order Pick Up (OPU) team which means that whenever you order something from the Target app, I am one of the people who get your order ready! Its not a bad job, its actually super easy, but navigating a balance between work and school can be challenging.

                    I enlisted into the Navy as a Hospital Corpsman in 2018. I went to basic training in Illinois, then to my job school in San Antonio, Tx. From there I went to my first duty Station in Lemoore, Ca and was there for two years. While I was there I went on the USNS Mercy, a hospital ship that was stationed in Long Beach, Ca for a COVID Relief mission. We would take patient transfers from surrounding hospitals that were at capacity because of the Corona Virus.
                    After the USNS Mercy, I went to a Level One Trauma Center in Cleveland, Oh for a Trauma Care course before being stationed with a Marine Corps Unit to better my knowledge with trauma care because of the environments associated with being attached to a Marine Unit.

                    <br />
                    After my Trauma course, I was stationed with 5th Air Naval Gunfire Liason Company (ANGLICO) in April 2021 in Okinawa, Japan. This duty station taught me to not let the little things hild me back because there are always tougher scenerios. For example, we stayed in the jungle for 2 weeks on a training operation where we would try to find and eliminate another teams base. It was like capture the flag, except with paint rounds fire from a real rifle. It was a lot of fun, but also very informative of an operational life style.
                    I was discharged in May of 2022 and started my university studies in Fall of 2022.
